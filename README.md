# VEDA - AR Math Solver

Veda is an app that can solve mathematical problems in a more interactive way.
Can be used by anyone who studies Maths. To improve learning and also cross check solutions.

Points the camera to a math problem:
 - Displays solutions step-by-step by our math solver model.
 - in real time using AR.

## Features

- AR integrated math solver - real time scanning and math solving.
- Veda can read and solve both handwritten notes and printed texts.
- Veda provides tips and tricks from different areas of mathematics.
- It also provides steps in calculations for easy understanding.
